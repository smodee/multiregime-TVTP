\title{multiregimeTVTP: Multi-Regime Time-Varying Transition Probability Models}
\description{
Implements regime-switching models with time-varying transition probabilities. Supports constant, autoregressive (TVP), exogenous variable-driven, and score-driven (GAS) transition dynamics following Bazzi et al. (2017). Handles arbitrary K-regime models with both diagonal and off-diagonal transition probability parameterizations.
