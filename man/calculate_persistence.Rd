\title{Post-Estimation Analysis Functions for Regime-Switching Models}
\usage{
calculate_persistence(filtered_probs)
}
\arguments{
\item{filtered_probs}{Matrix of filtered probabilities (T x K)}
}
\value{
List with persistence metrics
}
\description{
This file contains functions for analyzing and summarizing results from
regime-switching models with time-varying transition probabilities.
These functions work with output from all implemented model types:
\itemize{
\item Constant transition probability models
\item Time-varying probability (TVP) models
\item Exogenous variable-driven models
\item Generalized Autoregressive Score (GAS) models
}
}
\details{
All functions expect filtered probabilities in the standard format:
a T×K matrix where T is the number of time periods and K is the number
of regimes, with each row representing probabilities at time t.

Main functions:
\itemize{
\item calculate_persistence(): Regime persistence and transition metrics
\item \link[future:Future-class]{future::Future}: Model comparison utilities, forecasting metrics, etc.
}

Dependencies: None (base R only)
Calculate regime persistence metrics

Calculates various metrics about regime persistence and transitions
from the filtered probability sequences.
