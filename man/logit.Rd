\title{General utility functions for regime switching models
These functions provide general mathematical and data processing utilities
that are needed across different parts of the regime switching models.
Logit transformation (natural space -> unconstrained space)}
\usage{
logit(x, eps = .Machine$double.eps)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Value in [0,1] to transform}

\item{eps}{Small value to prevent boundary issues (default: .Machine$double.eps)}
}
\value{
Transformed value in (-∞,∞)
}
