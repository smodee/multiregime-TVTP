\title{Clamped logistic transformation (unconstrained space -> bounded natural space)}
\usage{
logistic_clamped(x, eps = 1e-10)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Value in (-∞,∞) to transform}

\item{eps}{Small value for boundary clamping (default: 1e-10)}
}
\value{
Transformed value in [eps, 1-eps]
}
\description{
Clamped logistic transformation (unconstrained space -> bounded natural space)
}
\details{
This function matches the original HMMGAS C implementation which uses:
p = eps + (1-2*eps)/(1+exp(-x))

This maps the unconstrained value x to the interval [eps, 1-eps] rather than (0,1),
providing numerical stability when probabilities are used in subsequent calculations
involving log(), division by p*(1-p), etc.

The default eps=1e-10 matches the original HMMGAS implementation.

NOTE ON MODEL-SPECIFIC USAGE:
This clamped version is used ONLY by the GAS model. The original HMMGAS C code
applies this clamping specifically in GAS (Filtering_2RegimesGAS.c) but uses
standard logistic in TVP (Filtering_2RegimesTVP.c) and Exogenous models.
This is because the GAS score calculation involves terms like p*(1-p) in the
denominator, making numerical stability more critical.
