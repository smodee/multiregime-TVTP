\usage{
setup_gauss_hermite_quadrature(y, n_nodes = 30, method = "data_based")
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{Observed time series data}

\item{n_nodes}{Number of quadrature nodes (default: 30)}

\item{method}{Method for determining quadrature parameters ("data_based" or "standardized")}
}
\value{
List containing quadrature setup information
}
\description{
This file implements score calculation for GAS (Generalized Autoregressive Score)
models following Bazzi et al. (2017).
}
\details{
Main functions:
\itemize{
\item calculate_gas_score(): Compute scaled score vector for GAS dynamics
\item setup_gauss_hermite_quadrature(): Setup numerical integration for Fisher Information
\item apply_moore_penrose_scaling(): Apply scaling to raw score vectors
}

The implementation supports both diagonal (p11, p22, ...) and off-diagonal
parameterizations of transition probabilities. For K=2 with diag_probs=TRUE,
results are identical to the original HMMGAS C implementation.
Setup Gauss-Hermite quadrature for GAS score scaling

Sets up Gauss-Hermite quadrature nodes and weights for numerical integration
in the Fisher Information calculation. Following the original implementation,
the quadrature is centered around the median of the data with scale based on
the standard deviation.

IMPORTANT: The integration domain is limited to ±4 standard deviations to avoid
numerical issues where regime densities become negligible (< 1e-10). This prevents
quadrature node failures that can bias parameter estimation toward zero.

The "data_based" method uses median(y) and sd(y) as in the original implementation.
The "standardized" method uses mean=0, sd=1 for standardized integration.

\examples{
# Setup quadrature based on data characteristics
y <- rnorm(1000)
gh_setup <- setup_gauss_hermite_quadrature(y)

# Setup with more nodes for higher precision
gh_setup <- setup_gauss_hermite_quadrature(y, n_nodes = 50)

# Use standardized approach
gh_setup <- setup_gauss_hermite_quadrature(y, method = "standardized")
}
