\description{
Logistic transformation (unconstrained space -> natural space)
}
\details{
Standard logistic function used by TVP and Exogenous models.

NOTE ON MODEL-SPECIFIC USAGE:
\itemize{
\item TVP model: Uses standard logistic() - matches original HMMGAS C implementation
\item Exogenous model: Uses standard logistic() - matches original HMMGAS C implementation
\item GAS model: Uses logistic_clamped() - matches original HMMGAS C implementation
}

The original HMMGAS package applies probability clamping [1e-10, 1-1e-10] only
in the GAS model, not in TVP or Exogenous models. This asymmetry exists in the
original C code and is preserved here for consistency.
