#' Post-Estimation Analysis Functions for Regime-Switching Models
#' 
#' This file contains functions for analyzing and summarizing results from
#' regime-switching models with time-varying transition probabilities.
#' These functions work with output from all implemented model types:
#' - Constant transition probability models
#' - Time-varying probability (TVP) models  
#' - Exogenous variable-driven models
#' - Generalized Autoregressive Score (GAS) models
#'
#' All functions expect filtered probabilities in the standard format:
#' a TÃ—K matrix where T is the number of time periods and K is the number
#' of regimes, with each row representing probabilities at time t.
#'
#' Main functions:
#' - calculate_persistence(): Regime persistence and transition metrics
#' - [Future]: Model comparison utilities, forecasting metrics, etc.
#'
#' Dependencies: None (base R only)

#' Helper function to calculate regime persistence metrics
#'
#' @param filtered_probs Matrix of filtered probabilities (T x K)
#' @return List with persistence metrics
#' @details
#' Calculates various metrics about regime persistence and transitions
#' from the filtered probability sequences.

      avg_durations[k] <- 0
    }
