Description: Implements regime-switching models with time-varying transition
    probabilities. Supports constant, autoregressive (TVP), exogenous
    variable-driven, and score-driven (GAS) transition dynamics following
    Bazzi et al. (2017). Handles arbitrary K-regime models with both
    diagonal and off-diagonal transition probability parameterizations.
